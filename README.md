# Travelify

Your guide when traveling to unfamiliar places.

## Description

**Travelify** is a mobile application that provides users with various features such as **Filtering**, **Viewing Place Details**, and **Adding to Favorites**.

## Features

- **Filtering**: When accessing a location on our map, we can perform filtering in two ways. The first is filtering by categories, which include Restaurants, Hotels, and Tourist Places. The second is filtering by ratings, with options such as 3.5, 4.5, 5, and All.

- **Viewing Place Details**: At the bottom of the application, a menu will open, and the location's position on the map will be highlighted in an animated way. We can scroll through this menu to access details such as Image, Name, Rating, Address, Website, Phone Number, Price Information, Ranking, Awards received, and the place's TripAdvisor page.

- **Adding To Favorites**: We can add places we like to our favorites by clicking the button above the respective place's image in the menu below. Afterwards, we can view these places in the favorites section of our application.
